### Differentiation Opportunity

**Key gaps in existing tools we can address:**

1. **Performance First**: Build a lightweight, fast kanban that handles 1000+ cards without lag (unlike Jira)
2. **Native WIP Limits**: Built-in WIP limits per column with visual indicators (missing from Trello)
3. **Simple but Complete**: Balance Trello's simplicity with essential advanced features
4. **Keyboard-First**: Power users can manage boards entirely via keyboard shortcuts
5. **Clean UI**: Minimize clutter, no ads, focus on the board itself
6. **Smooth Drag-Drop**: Butter-smooth animations and instant feedback
7. **Offline Support**: Local-first architecture for responsiveness

### Target User Profile

- Small to medium teams (2-20 people)
- Developers, designers, and product teams
- Users frustrated with Jira's complexity but need more than basic Trello
- Teams wanting speed and keyboard efficiency
