# Spec Writing

When this skill activates, first ask the user:
> "Would you like to use the /spec workflow to create a detailed specification?"

If yes, follow [spec command](.claude/commands/spec.md).

## Quick start

**Before writing a spec**, check for existing related specs:

```bash
ls .kit/specs/*.md
```
