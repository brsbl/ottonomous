## Philosophy

### Subagents for Context Isolation

Use subagents to isolate concerns and prevent context pollution:

- **Context isolation**: Each subagent gets only what it needs, nothing more. Orchestrator agent delegates to and manages subagent
- **Specialization**: Different expertise per agent (frontend-developer vs backend-architect, senior-code-reviewer vs architect-reviewer, test-writer, etc)

### Skill/Subagent Separation

Skills and subagents have distinct responsibilities:

- **Skills** define *what* to hand off (file list, diff command, scope, context) and are instructions for the Orchestrator agent
- **Subagents** define *how* to process what's handed off (criteria, detection rules, output format)

This keeps subagents self-contained and reusable while skills orchestrate the workflow.

### Swarm Orchestration

Skills coordinate multiple subagents working in parallel using `run_in_background: true`:

**Coordination patterns:**
- **Fan-out/Fan-in** — Spawn N agents, wait for all, synthesize results. Used by `/review`.
- **Batches** — Complete batch N before starting N+1 (for dependent work). Used by `/review fix`.
- **Pipeline** — Sequential handoff between specialists. Used by `/otto`.

**Scaling:** 1-4 items = 1 agent, 5-10 = 2-3 agents, 11+ = 3-5 agents. Group by directory or component type.

### Iterative Review for Verification

Every phase has explicit verification:

- **Planning**: spec → spec review → user approval
- **Implementation**: code → code review → fix → commit
- **Verification criteria**: Each step defines "Done when..."
- **Prioritized findings**: P0-P2 across all skills (P0 = critical, P1 = important, P2 = minor)

## Recommended Workflow

```
/spec                     # define requirements via interview
  │
  ▼
/task                     # break spec into sessions & tasks
  │
  ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│                   │

/next batch         │     # implement sessions of tasks in parallel then stage results
│                   │

/test write staged  │     # generate tests, then lint/typecheck/run all

Use `/clear` between steps to reset context.

## Skills

### Specification & Planning

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/spec [idea]` | Researches best practices, interviews you to define requirements and design. `technical-product-manager` validates completeness, consistency, feasibility, and technical correctness. |
| `/spec revise {spec}` | Saves a comprehensive spec and goes straight to review with codebase exploration, skipping the interview. |
| `/spec list` | Lists all specs with id, name, status, and created date. |
| `/task <spec-id>` | Creates atomic tasks grouped into agent sessions. `principal-engineer` reviews work breakdown, dependencies, and completeness. |
| `/task list` | Lists all tasks and their spec, sessions, status etc. |

### Implementation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/next` | Returns next task id. |
| `/next session` | Returns next session id. |
| `/next <id>` | Launches subagent to implement task or session. Plans first, then implements. |
| `/next batch` | Implements all highest-priority unblocked sessions in parallel. |

### Testing

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/test run` | Lint, type check, run tests. |
| `/test write` | `test-writer` generates tests for pure functions with edge cases, then runs pipeline. |
| `/test browser` | Visual verification with browser automation. |
| `/test all` | Run + browser combined. |

**Scope:** `staged`, `branch` (default)

### Code Review

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/review` | Multi-agent code review. `architect-reviewer` checks system structure and boundaries; `senior-code-reviewer` checks correctness, security, performance; `false-positive-validator` filters out invalid findings. |
| `/review fix` | Implements all fixes from plan in parallel batches. |
| `/review fix P0` | Implements only P0 (critical) fixes. |
| `/review fix P0-P1` | Implements P0 and P1 fixes. |

**Scope:** `staged`, `branch` (default)

### Documentation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/summary` | Synthesizes code docs into semantic HTML summary explaining what changed and why. Primarily a resource to complement or replace code review. |

**Scope:** `staged`, `branch` (default)

### Automation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/otto <idea>` | Autonomous spec → tasks → [next/test/review] per session → summary. Best for greenfield explorations, prototyping, scoped migrations, and simple applications. **Not recommended for building complex apps end-to-end.** |
| `/reset [targets]` | Resets workflow data. Targets: `tasks`, `specs`, `sessions`, `all` (default). Docs are preserved. |

### Utilities

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/browser <url>` | Navigate to URL, capture screenshot and ARIA snapshot. |
| `/browser explore` | Interactive browser exploration. |
| `/browser verify` | Verify specific UI behavior or state. |
| `/browser extract` | Extract specific data from the frontend. |
